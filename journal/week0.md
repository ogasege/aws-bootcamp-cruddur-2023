# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

This weeek, I was able to complete my homework without any issue. 
For my assignment challenges, I:
## Watched Week 0 - Live Streamed Video
I learnt about how it is to work on projects in the real world from the characters in the scenario used during the livestream. I also learnt about the iron triangle and how it applies to various projects depending on the objectives. 

## Watched Chirag's Week 0 - Spend Considerations
I understood the free tier plan that AWS offers and I will ensure that I conider the costs pf resources before I use them during the course of this bootcamp as well as in other projects. 

## Watched Ashish's Week 0 - Security Considerations
I understand the part I have to play as a cloud engineer in ensuring that I ensure that best practices for security are always employed and I got more eye openers as I watched this video. 

## Recreated Conceptual Diagram in Lucid Charts and on a Napkin
Using a napkin, I made this conceeptual diagram. I added features such as crud alarms, crud backups as well as crud scheduling (twitter killer indeedðŸ‘ŒðŸ˜‰)

The conceptual design was recreated on Lucid Chart.

## Created an Admin User
I created an admin user which will be used for the bootcamp to comply with best practices of not using your root user except for very specific tasks.

## Used Cloudshell

## Generated AWS Credentials

## Installed and used AWS CLI 

The used AWS CLI commands can be found below:
```
tasks:
  - name: aws-cli
    env:
      AWS_CLI_AUTO_PROMPT: on-partial
    init: |
      cd /workspace
      curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
      unzip awscliv2.zip
      sudo ./aws/install  
      cd $THEIA_WORKSPACE_ROOT
vscode:
  extensions:
    - 42Crunch.vscode-openapi
```


## Created a Budget and a Billing Alarm
I created a $1 dollar budget and set up a billing alarm using 80% of the chosen metric as the threshold. I created the budget using the AWS CLI commands and used the management console to set up the billing alarm. 

## Created an SNS topic
I created an SNS topic and subscribed using my mail address provided.
