# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

This week, I was able to complete everything on the to-do list in the student bootcamp website. As for the homework challenges, I:
- Ran the dockerfile CMD as an external script
- Pushed and tagged an image to DockerHub
- Used multi-stage building for a Dockerfile build
- Implemented a health check in the V3 Docker compose file
-Scanned for vulnerabilities in my bootcamp repository using Snyk

- Implemented some best practices on my Dockerfiles by ensuring no sensitive data such as my AWS
credentials was in my files
- Installed Docker on my local machine and got the same containers running on my laptop.
- Launched an EC2 instance that has docker installed and pulled the container I created
